      UNIX has become the backbone of the technical infrastructure of the modern world,
      as it introduced the idea of cross-platform standardization. Programs could be re-compiled
      for various architectures as long as the hardware was running UNIX.
      There are many of variations on UNIX, however they all follow the same
      standards and systems that Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie wrote in 1969 for Bell Labs.
      A tree of some of these variants can be seen below:

      Ken Thompson also helped develop the UTF-8 encoding scheme, which is able to encode all valid
      Unicode points using one to four 8-bit bytes. This has also become the international standard,
      with it being used as the character encoding for more than half the websites on the internet.
