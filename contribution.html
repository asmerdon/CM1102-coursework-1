      Ken Thompson, along with his colleague Dennis Ritchie, created the UNIX operating system in 1969.
      The key characteristic of UNIX operating systems is the fact theyâ€™re modular, with the OS containing
      a set of simple tools that each perform their own well-defined function. It was developed in C, as
      opposed to a platform-specific assembly language.
      This means that it can have portability across multiple computer systems.
      The development of UNIX also helped with the development of C as a language, helping it become one of
      the most widely used programming languages (even to this day).

      Key features of UNIX are: the Kernal, the Shell, a file fystem, a development environment,
      commands and documentation on said commands.

      Since 2006, Ken has worked at Google, where he helped develop the Go programming language along with
      Robert Griesemer and Rob Pike. The Go programming language is very similar to C in terms of syntax,
      however it has the added benefits of memory saftey. It is also entierly free with compiler, tools and
      source code being open source.
