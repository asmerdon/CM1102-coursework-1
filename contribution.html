      Ken Thompson, along with his colleague Dennis Ritchie, created the UNIX operating system in 1969.
      The key characteristic of UNIX operating systems is the fact theyâ€™re modular, with the OS containing
      a set of simple tools that each perform their own well-defined function. It was developed in C, as
      opposed to a platform-specific assembly language.
      This means that it can have portability across multiple computer systems.
      The development of UNIX also helped with the development of C as a language, helping it become one of
      the most widely used programming languages (even to this day).

      Key features of UNIX are: the Kernal, the Shell, a file fystem, a development environment,
      commands and documentation on said commands.
